\section{UML Notation}
\label{section:UMLNotation}

To describe software components of the system UML notation has been used \cite{UML}.

While the class diagrams of UML typically represents actual class structures within an Object-Oriented programming language, we have in this project used class diagrams to describe the header files of our software components. This has been done because it is a practical way to describe the interfaces of software components within the system and their association to each other. Public and private descriptors for methods and attributes have been used in order to indicate which should only be used internally by the software component itself, and which are meant to be used by other software components.
