\section{JTAG Debugging}
	During the development process the debug-simulator has been used to debug areas of code. During the development process the group experienced areas where debugging with the simulator was not possible due to hardware timing and on-chip memory management. To ease the debugging process and visualize the data in the microcontroller's memory, we used the Atmel ICE JTAG debugger. 
	
	Using the JTAG debugger we were able to live debug on the microcontroller. This was an advantage since we could see the contents of the registers and memory, which was crucial when implementing the logic for storing high score data. Using the JTAG debugger we could see where the data was stored, run through the retrieval logic and locate the errors.
