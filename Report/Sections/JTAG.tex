\section{JTAG Debugging}
	During the development process the simulator has been used to debug areas of logic. During the process the group experienced areas og logic, where debugging with the simulator has not been possible. This was the logic for storing and retrieving values from volatile memory of the ATMega2560. To ease the debugging process and visualize the data in the microcontroller's memory, we used the Atmel ICE JTAG debugger. 
	
	Using the JTAG debugger we were able to live debug on the microcontroller. This was an advantage since we could see the contents of the registers and memory, which was crucial when implementing the logic for storing high score data. Using the JTAG debugger we could see where the data was stored, run through the retrieval logic and localize the errors.
