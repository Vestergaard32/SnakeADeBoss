\subsection{FoodProcessor}
	The FoodProcessor's responsibility is to generate a random position for food placement. The FoodProcessor class is used when the snake collides with currently placed food, where a new position is the generated. Figure \ref{fig:classFood} shows a class diagram of the FoodProcessor.

	The figure shows that the new position is wrapped in a Position struct which contains the x and y values. The parameters for the single function in the FoodProcessor are the constraints to the generated Position. GenerateFoodPosition uses a random number generator function \textit{rand()} to generate two values for the x and y positions.
