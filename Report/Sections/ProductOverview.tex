\section{Product Overview}
In this product we want to recreate the old SNAKE game from the Nokia 3310 phone. The game will be created using an Nokia 5110 48 x 84 LCD matric display; the same model that was used in the original Nokia 3310. The user will use a matrix keyboard to control the snake in the same way as in the original game. The system is driven by an ATMEGA 2560 that will read the user input, do the game calculations, and draw the game onto the display.
