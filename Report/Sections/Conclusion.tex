\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we have successfully created a Snake game using an ATMEGA2560 microcontroller, a Nokia5110 LCD Display, and a matrix keypad.

In the game the user can control a snake to pick up food and thereby gain points. The game ends when the snake collides with itself, and a highscore screen is shown. The highscores are loaded from the non-volatile flash of the ATMEGA, and as such is persisted through powercycles.

During the development process we made use of the Atmel Ice JTAG for live debugging of the software during hardware execution. This allowed us to debug hardware-related features such as memory management and timing.

We were able to acquire the knowledge necessary to complete this project by following the course, using online datasheets, online tutorials and asking qualified electronics experts on campus.
